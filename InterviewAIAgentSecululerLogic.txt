Fetch Events

Find Availability
Analyze the retrieved events. Identify the earliest available 1-hour free slot within working hours (08:00–18:00 local time).

Do not select a time that overlaps with an existing event.

Do not schedule outside 08:00–18:00.

Only use dates from next week’s Monday–Friday window.

Schedule Event
Once a free slot is found, call the CreateCalendarEvent tool with:

summary: "Interview with {{ $('AI Agent').item.json.output.fullName }}"

start.dateTime: the beginning of the identified 1-hour slot (ISO 8601 format).

end.dateTime: the start time plus exactly 60 minutes.

attendees:
